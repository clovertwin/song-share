# Song Share

## A simplified clone of the Spotify music app

This app was built using Next.js, React, Typescript, and Tailwind css. All data is fetched using the Spotify Web Api.
I used NextAuth to help with Authorization.

## How to use

Think of this as a wrapper for your Spotify. If you have the Spotify app running on a device you can use this to
control your app - search Spotify and play songs, see your playlists, and adjust the volume on your device. If you
do not have a device running the official Spotify app this will not be able to play music but can still search Spotify.

## To-do

- Add css for responsive tablet and mobile layouts
- Mobile menu
- Library component
